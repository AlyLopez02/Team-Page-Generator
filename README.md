## Installation
Download these files from this GitHub Repository and then type `npm i` in your terminal for the folder with said files. 

## Usage
Type `node index.js` into the same terminal you used for the installation. You will then be prompted for information about the manager of the team. After answering those questions, you will be prompted to choose if you would like to add an engineer, add an intern, or exit so that your team page can be created. Then, an html file labeled `team-page.html` will be created into the dist folder. You now have your team page! 

## Tests
There are tests for all four classes created. Type `npm test` in the same terminal as above to run them.
